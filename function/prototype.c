/**
 * A function prototype in C is a declaration of a function that specifies the return type, function name, and the types and number of parameters the function takes, but does not provide a function definition or implementation. The purpose of function prototypes is to provide the compiler with information about the function's signature, so that it can check the correct number and type of arguments being passed to the function when it is called.

Here's an example of a function prototype in C:

int max(int a, int b);
In this example, max is the name of the function, int is the return type of the function, and (int a, int b) are the arguments of the function.

The main usage of function prototypes is to provide type checking for functions. The compiler can check the number, types, and order of arguments passed to the function against the function prototype, and it will give an error if there is a mismatch. This helps to catch errors at compile time instead of run time, which can make debugging easier.

Another usage of function prototypes is to allow the compiler to arrange the functions in a particular order, which can be useful in large programs where functions are defined in multiple files. By specifying the function prototypes in a header file, the compiler can ensure that the functions are correctly linked even if they are defined in different files.
The purpose of function prototypes in C is to provide the compiler with information about the function's signature, including its return type, name, and the types and number of parameters it takes. This information is used for several purposes:

Type Checking: The compiler can check the number and types of arguments being passed to the function against the function prototype, and it will give an error if there is a mismatch. This helps to catch errors at compile time instead of run time, which makes debugging easier.

Linking: Function prototypes allow the compiler to arrange functions in a particular order, which can be useful in large programs where functions are defined in multiple files. By specifying the function prototypes in a header file, the compiler can ensure that the functions are correctly linked even if they are defined in different files.

Forward Declaration: Function prototypes allow you to declare functions that will be defined in a separate file, so that they can be used in multiple files without having to include the entire function definition in each file. This helps to avoid circular dependencies between files.

Code Reuse: Function prototypes make it easier to reuse code by providing a standard way of declaring functions that can be used in multiple files and by different programmers.

Overall, function prototypes play a crucial role in ensuring that functions are used correctly and that programs are well-organized, maintainable, and scalable.
