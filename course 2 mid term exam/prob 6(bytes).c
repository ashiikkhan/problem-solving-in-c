/*
=>How much bytes does an int type array with 12 elements take in memory?
Ans: 
The amount of memory an array takes in memory depends on the data type of the array elements and the number of elements.
In the case of an int type array with 12 elements, each elements takes 4 bytes of memory because int data type is typically 4 bytes in size. Therefore, the total element of memory the array takes in memory is: 4 bytes * 12 elements = 48 bytes.
It is worth mentioning that, this is the amount of memory used by the array elements and doesn't include any memory used by the array itself. The array takes memory for metadata. Metadata is the information about the array, such as its data type, size, and other properties. The amount of memory used for metadata is dependent on the implementation of the programming language and the specific data type of the array.
